# Thesis

This is my undergraduate thesis.

## Thesis Template

This thesis uses the LaTeX template from [**sfuthesis**](https://github.com/rchurchley/sfuthesis) project.

## TODO

Before you submit your thesis, please make sure to **double-check all style requirements** on the [SFU Library website](http://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/writing/thesis).
There are several standards (e.g. abstract word limits) that LaTeX cannot automatically arrange for you, and you are ultimately responsible for making sure that your thesis conforms to the regulations set out by the library.
