%
%   Note to future contributors
%   ===========================
%
%   When writing this class, we incorporated many lessons learned from the long
%   history of the previous template. We hope to preserve some of those lessons
%   here to explain some of our choices and to help inform your contributions.
%
%   - This class, unlike most LaTeX bundles, is not distributed as a .dtx file.
%     The previous template was, for a time, but as of 2014 the .dtx file was
%     several years out of date. As future contributions to this class will
%     likely come from users who have directly modified this class file to suit
%     their needs, we have decided not to bother with the overhead of managing
%     the .dtx.
%
%   - The old template contained a considerable amount of vestigial plain TeX;
%     later contributors preferred to append to the template, understandably
%     not wanting to mess with decades-old unfamiliar code. This class has been
%     written with readability in mind: we use indentation, spacing, verbose
%     macro names, and comments to document our code. Where possible, we
%     prefer using LaTeX and etoolbox macros over plain TeX.
%
%   - This class also includes basic standard packages like `geometry` and
%     `setspace` to improve its readability and maintainability. (Almost fifty
%     lines of the old template could be replaced by two RequirePackages!)
%     But we have endeavored to keep the dependencies to a minimum in order to
%     reduce potential incompatabilities with user-loaded packages.
%
%
%   Dependencies
%   ============
%
%   This class uses the following external packages:
%
%   `appendix` to add the word "Appendix" to the Table of Contents
%   `etoolbox` used for class options
%   `fontenc` used to improve accented character output
%   `geometry` used for Margins
%   `lmodern` used for Fonts
%   `nowidow` used to prevent nearly-empty pages
%   `setspace` used for Line Spacing
%   `tocloft` used for making the ToC nicer

%   CLASS OPTIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   The library requires a slightly different approval page format if the
%   thesis is accepted without a defence taking place. If this applies to you,
%   use the `undefended` class option to format the approval page correctly.
%
%   The SFU Library has moved to digital-only thesis submission and no longer
%   requires print copies of theses be submitted. However, if you do want to
%   print your thesis, you can use the `bound` or `twoside` option to set
%   margins for book binding.
%

\RequirePackage{etoolbox}
\newtoggle{undefended}
\newtoggle{bound}

\DeclareOption{undefended}{\toggletrue{undefended}}

}{%else
    \PassOptionsToClass{oneside}{book}
}

\PassOptionsToClass{11pt}{book}


%   BASE CLASS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   sfuthesis.cls is based on the standard `book` document class.
%   For more information (including standard class options), see
%   http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/classes.pdf
%   or type `texdoc book` on the command line.
%

\DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{book}}

\ProcessOptions
\LoadClass{book}


%   FONTS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Use the Latin Modern implementation of Computer Modern, for better support
%   of diacritics and non-English glyphs, including correct PDF search.
%   The fontenc package ensures proper hyphenation of accented words.
%

\RequirePackage{lmodern}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}


%   MARGINS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Sets the margins to 1.25" on the left and right, 1" on the top, and
%   0.7" from the bottom to the page numbers. Invoking the `twoside` option
%   will bypass this and allow margins be set by the underlying book class.
%

\RequirePackage{geometry}[2010/09/12]

    \newgeometry{
        top=1in,

        bottom=0.7in,
        right=1.25in,
        includefoot   % ensure page numbers do not extend into margins
    }
}


%   LINE SPACING  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Sets 1.5 line spacing for the document body and provides a command to set
%   single-spacing for the "backmatter" (references, bibliography, appendices).
%   These commands do not affect spacing inside figures, tables, and other
%   floats, which remain single-spaced.
%

\RequirePackage{setspace}
\newcommand{\defaultspacing}{\onehalfspacing}
\newcommand{\smallspacing}{\singlespacing}

\defaultspacing
\renewcommand{\backmatter}{\smallspacing\clearpage}


%   PAGINATION  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Provides commands to set page numbers in roman numerals for preliminary
%   pages (frontmatter) and arabic numbers for all other content (mainmatter).
%   \pagestyle{plain} sets page numbers in the bottom center.
%

\pagestyle{plain}

\apptocmd{\frontmatter}{%
    \pagenumbering{roman}
}

\apptocmd{\mainmatter}{%
    \pagenumbering{arabic}
}


%   WIDOWS AND ORPHANS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Prevents LaTeX's page-breaking algorithm from interrupting paragraphs or
%   creating nearly-empty pages.
%

\RequirePackage[all]{nowidow}


%   TITLE PAGE  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Generates a correctly-formatted title page, provided the following
