\begin{abstract}
Swift is a new programming language developed by Apple, designed to replace Objective-C as the main programming language on Apple platforms. This paper introduces Babel Swift, a new conversion tool for converting Objective-C code to Swift. Our tool focuses on converting code snippets, including functions, code blocks, and statements. The most important feature of Babel Swift is the ability to convert incomplete code snippets with undefined identifiers. Furthermore, Babel Swift could generate Swift-only syntax. At last, we evaluate Babel Swift by comparing with other existing tools.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Objective-C and Swift}

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language. It's the main programming language used by Apple on its OS X and iOS platforms. In 2014, Apple introduced the new Swift language, which is being designed to replace Objective-C for building iOS and OS X apps.

\section{Existing Objective-C to Swift Conversion Tools}

Considering there are a lot of Objective-C code on Apple platforms, there is a high demand for Objective-C to Swift conversion tools. objc2swift \cite{objc2swift} is an open-source conversion tool. Swiftify \cite{swiftify} and iSwift \cite{iswift} are two commercial conversion tools.

These conversion tools are all designed for transform complete code or complete projects. They cannot handle incomplete code snippets with undefined identifiers. However, converting incomplete code snippets is a typical use case of conversion tools. For example, a programmer may find an Objective-C code snippet on Stackoverflow, and wants to use it in a Swift project.

\section{Introducing Babel Swift}

This paper introduces Babel Swift, a new conversion tool for converting Objective-C code to Swift. Babel Swift was designed for handling incomplete code snippets. It could also generate Swift-specific code, e.g., it has the ability to convert C-style \texttt{for} loops to \texttt{for-in} statements and \texttt{stride} in Swift. Babel Swift is written in Python, based on libclang \cite{libclang}.

% TODO: other features?

\chapter{Objectives and Implementation}

Babel Swift is an Objective-C to Swift code conversion tool. It has two main objectives -- converting incomplete code snippets, and generating Swift-specific code.

\section{Overall Design}

Babel Swift is written in Python, based on libclang \cite{libclang} and its Python binding. libclang is a C interface to Clang \cite{clang}, which is a C language family frontend for LLVM. libclang provides a small API for parsing source code and accessing the parsed abstract syntax tree (AST). By using Clang as the parser, we can focus on improving the conversion.

In libclang, a \emph{cursor} represent a location within the AST. Our transform function takes a cursor as input, and outputs the converted Swift code. For each cursor, the transform function traverses all the children and transform them recursively.

\section{Handling Code Snippets}

In this paper, we use the term \emph{code snippet} to represent a piece of code \emph{within} a function. A code snippet consists of one or more statements. An example of Objective-C \emph{code snippet} would be (\texttt{NSPopover} is a class in \emph{AppKit}, a foundational framework used in Mac development):

\lstset{language=[Objective]C, caption={A code snippet}, breaklines=true}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
NSInteger answer = 42;
if (answer == 42) {
    NSPopover *popover = [[NSPopover alloc] init];
    [popover run];
}
\end{lstlisting}

Although it seems to be easy to handle code snippets, libclang refuses to parse them. For Objective-C, libclang expects the input to be a complete source file. To overcome this limitation, Babel Swift wraps the input code snippet into a complete source file. In the example above, the wrapped input for libclang is:

\lstset{language=[Objective]C, caption={A complete source file containing the snippet}, breaklines=true}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
#import <AppKit/AppKit.h>
#import "BabelSwiftHeader.h"

@implementation __BABEL_SWIFT_WRAPPER_CLASS__

- (id)__BABEL_SWIFT_WRAPPER_METHOD__ {

NSInteger answer = 42;
if (answer == 42) {
    NSPopover *popover = [[NSPopover alloc] init];
    [popover run];
}

}

@end
\end{lstlisting}

We use a special class name \texttt{\_\_BABEL\_SWIFT\_WRAPPER\_CLASS\_\_} and a special method name \texttt{\_\_BABEL\_SWIFT\_WRAPPER\_METHOD\_\_} to wrap the snippet. We also import two headers. \texttt{AppKit/AppKit.h} contains many fundamental declarations in Cocoa, e.g. \texttt{NSInteger} and \texttt{NSDictionary}. \texttt{BabelSwiftHeader.h} is for handling \emph{incomplete code snippets}, which will be elaborated in the next section.

\section{Handling Incomplete Code Snippets}

We define an \emph{incomplete code snippet} as a code snippet which contains undefined identifiers. For example, the following Objective-C code snippet is an \emph{incomplete code snippet}, because both \texttt{speed} and \texttt{TimeMachine} are undefined identifiers.

\lstset{language=[Objective]C, caption={An incomplete code snippet}, breaklines=true}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
if (speed == 88) {
    TimeMachine *timeMachine = [[TimeMachine alloc] init];
    [timeMachine run];
}
\end{lstlisting}
