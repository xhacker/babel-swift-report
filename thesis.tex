%
%   Add any packages or custom commands you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:

%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc

%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
