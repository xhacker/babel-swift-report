%   PACKAGES AND CUSTOMIZATIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages or custom commands you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.

\begin{abstract}
Swift is a new programming language developed by Apple, designed to replace Objective-C as the main programming language on Apple platforms. This thesis introduces a new transformation tool for converting Objective-C code to Swift. Our tool focuses on converting code snippets, including functions, code blocks, and statements. The features of our tool include converting incomplete code snippets with undefined identifiers, as well as generating Swift-only syntax. We also evaluate the transformation tool by comparing with other existing tools.
